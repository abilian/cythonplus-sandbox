# cythonplus-sandbox

This repository contains code related to Cython+ usage, at different maturity levels.

-   `advanced_containers/`

      Experiment of a "any scaler" container implementation.

-   `benchmark_httpd_plus/`

      Scripts used for benchmarking the httpd-plus server.

-   `exemples/`

      Experiments, the results are intended to be moved over time to more structured
      folders.

-   `snippets/`

    A proposal, both as organization and content, for a collection of code snippets.
    The target is about ~50 code samples, making it possible to understand the main
    aspects of development with cython+ and serving
    as examples of good practice. This could simplify the writing of documentation.
